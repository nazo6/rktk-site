title: Setup
---

First, let's build an environment for using RKTK.

## 1. Install rust

RKTK is built with Rust, so Rust is required; there are various ways to install
Rust, but using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is recommended.

After install rust, make sure that the `cargo` command is available.

## 2. Install cargo-binutils

Next, install [cargo-binutils](https://github.com/rust-embedded/cargo-binutils).
This is needed to generate UF2 files.

```sh
cargo install cargo-binutils
# or if you have cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-binutils

rustup component add llvm-tools
```

## 3. Install rktk-cli

`rktk-cli` is command line interface for RKTK. It can be installed by cargo.

```sh
cargo +nightly install rktk-cli --git https://github.com/nazo6/rktk --bin rktk-cli
```

Note that `rktk-cli` requires nightly toolchain.
